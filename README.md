# Devanagari-Letters-DL

#### Goal
The primary goal for this project is to train a deep convolutional neural network that identifies characters of the Devanagari Script with a high level of accuracy.

#### Improvement Techniques 
##### Data Augmentation
Performing basic transformations (rotations, resclaing, cropping, etc.) can help to augment the data but there is a bottleneck to this approach. 
##### Add Noise to Training Images 
Using the Fast Gradient Sign Method to produce noise filters, training images will be randomly applied noise to improve model generalization

#### Current Testing Accuracy (updated 08/22): 98.81%
#### Current Testing F1 Score (updated 08/22): 98.814%
